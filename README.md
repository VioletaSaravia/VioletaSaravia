## 💫 About Me

Hi, I'm Violeta! I'm a self-taught programmer and Philosophy major from Argentina. I'm interested in distributed systems, data-oriented programming, and all things related to back-end development and optimization. I also dabble in games development and game tools programming.

## 🤓 Interests

- Back-end web development
- Software benchmarking, [performance-aware programming](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/welcome-to-the-performance-aware) and optimization
- Game engine/tools development (DIY, Godot)

## ⚗️ Projects

- Calibre: A mini-startup that offers up-to-date price tracking and statistics of products from MercadoLibre.com in a convenient format.
