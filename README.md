## 💫 About Me

Hi, I'm Violeta! I'm a self-taught programmer and Philosophy major from Argentina. I use this github account mainly for games development; I'm currently working on tooling for Godot.

## ⚗️ Projects

- [Motley](https://github.com/VioletaSaravia/Motley): A fast drawing tool for textmode art.
- [Overmind](https://github.com/VioletaSaravia/Overmind): A minimal but complete orbit camera system for godot, specially good for games that need smooth camera movement.
